DHT11 Initialization In MicroPython
----

A simple project that showcases how an external sensor like the DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor by Adafruit can be connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico to print out the data

DHT11 Versus Raspberry Pi Pico 
----

A simple example that aims to compare both the DHT11 Sensor's temperature performance versus the Raspberry Pi Pico's performance. Strangely enough, the Raspberry Pi Pico's built-in temperature sensor results seemed to be more accurate than the DHT11's results! It would be very interesting to see how the built-in sensor can compare with the more improved sensors
